       I attended Morehead State for my undergrad. <br>
        <br> I finished with a 4.0 in Elementary Education and Special Education. <br>  
         <hr> 
  I started teaching at Lawrence County High School using my special education degree. <br> <br> I worked there one year. <hr> 
  I then worked at Blaine Elementary School for 6 years. <br> <br> While at Blaine Elementary I completed a Master's Degree from Western Governors University. My degree there was in Curriculum and Instruction. <hr>
I then went to work at Louisa East Elementary. I have been there for 7 years now. <br> <br> Since I've been at Louisa East I have completed a second Master's Degree from Morehead State as well. This degree was in Curriculum and Instruction. This gave me my Rank 1. <br> <br> I also got my National Board Certification in Literacy. <br> <br> I decided to go back to school to get my Library Certificate in hopes of being the next librarian at Louisa East. <br> <br>
